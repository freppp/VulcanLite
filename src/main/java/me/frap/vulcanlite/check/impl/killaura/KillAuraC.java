 * A very simple, yet very effective, Keep Sprint check. We are just making sure that the player
 * decelerates after they attack a player. If not, it's a strong indication they're using Kill Aura
 * with Keep Sprint (this should flag a lot of auras, since using aura without keep sprint is no fun :().
